<h1>
  Foodify Application
</h1>

You need to create an application which will allow the user to get a random recipe and give him / her an ability to save it in the favorite dishes list.
1. Call the API endpoint “https://www.themealdb.com/api/json/v1/1/random.php” to fetch a random recipe and display it on the main page.
2. Add an ability to save or skip current recipes.
3. Saved recipes should be displayed on the other page (for example favorite recipes) and will persist their state after reloading the page.
4. Implement a modal window with form on the favorite recipes page to allow the user create his / her own recipes. Each recipe has to include a title and a cooking instruction.

Task requirements: <br/>
● You should use React for this app; <br/>
● API should be called once on page load, skip button should refetch random data from API; <br/>
● You can use any state manager you want or not use it at all; <br/>
● When you add custom dish, or when API has no image, you should show placeholder; <br/>
● Design is up to you; <br/>
● You can use any styling solution you want (sass, styled-components, CSS-in-JS, Tailwind); <br/>
● You can use UI libraries; <br/>
● Your app should be responsive and be able to adopt to mobile devices; <br/>
● Storing data in local-storage will be a plus; <br/>
● App should be stored on public github repo; <br/>
● You should use gh-pages to host your project; <br/>
● Make sure you provide both github and gh-pages links to our HR, when you finish the project. <br/>
